# FileApp
Using ArrayLists and file I/O, the program reads in two files, each one a CSV-formatted file representing a series of records. This produces a new (third) file which contains only the records which exist in the first file but do not exist in the second file. Use JFileChooser to allow the user to select the 3 files (2 input files and 1 output file).
